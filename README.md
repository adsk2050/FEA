Prediction of failure of Composite materials using FEA and Probabilistic analysis
Steps:
1. Finite element analysis implementation
2. Monte-Carlo stimulation by providing different sets of properties drawn from probability distribution
3. Separate MCS data into training and validation sets.
3. Train DL, ML models using the training set.
4. Compare with the results with MCS and check if the model accuracy is closer to MCS accuracy.
